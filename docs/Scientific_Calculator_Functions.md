# Scientific Calculator Functions

A scientific calculator is a powerful tool for students and professionals in various fields. It goes far beyond the basic arithmetic of a standard calculator, offering a wide array of functions to tackle complex mathematical, scientific, and engineering problems. Here's a comprehensive list of the functions you'll typically find on a scientific calculator, broken down by category. The latest version of **SciCalx** now includes inverse trigonometric functions, permutations, combinations, absolute value, and random number generation.

## **Basic & General Functions** ‚öôÔ∏è

These are the foundational operations, many of which are also present on a basic calculator, but with added capabilities on a scientific model.

| Function | Symbol(s) | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication, Division** | `+`, `-`, `√ó`, `√∑` | Performs the four basic arithmetic operations. |
| **Parentheses** | `( )` | Overrides the standard order of operations, allowing you to specify the order in which calculations are performed. |
| **Equals** | `=` | Executes the entered calculation. |
| **Answer Memory** | `Ans` | Recalls the result of the last calculation. |
| **Clear** | `AC`, `C`, `CE` | `AC` (All Clear) clears all input, while `C` or `CE` (Clear Entry) typically clears the most recent entry. |
| **Sign Change** | `+/-`, `(-)` | Changes the sign of the displayed number from positive to negative or vice versa. |
| **Percentage** | `%` | Calculates percentages. For example, `50 + 10%` would typically yield 55. |
